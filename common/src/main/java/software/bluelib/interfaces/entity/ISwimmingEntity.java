/**
 * Interface for managing swimming-related behaviors and properties of entities in the BlueLib library.
 * <p>
 * Purpose: This interface defines methods to manage the swimming state, speed, cooldown, and depth of entities.<br>
 * When: These methods are invoked during gameplay interactions, AI logic, or custom mechanics involving swimming entities.<br>
 * Where: Implemented by classes that manage entities with swimming capabilities.<br>
 * Additional Info: Utilizes {@link EntityStateManager} for managing states and attributes, and {@link Attributes} for swimming-related performance.<br>
 * </p>
 * Key Methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getSwimmingState(LivingEntity)} - Checks if the entity is currently swimming.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setSwimmingState(LivingEntity, boolean)} - Updates the swimming state of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getSwimmingSpeedMultiplier(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the swimming speed multiplier of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setSwimmingSpeedMultiplier(LivingEntity, double)} - Updates the swimming speed multiplier of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getSwimmingCooldown(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the cooldown period for the entity's swimming behavior.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setSwimmingCooldown(LivingEntity, int)} - Updates the cooldown period for the entity's swimming behavior.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getDepth(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the current depth (Y-coordinate) of the entity.</li>
 * </ul>
