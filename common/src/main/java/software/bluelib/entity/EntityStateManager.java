/**
 * Manages the state of entities in the BlueLib library.
 * <p>
 * Purpose: This class provides methods and data structures to manage various aspects of entity behavior and mechanics, including flying, swimming and taming.<br>
 * When: These methods are invoked during interactions or gameplay mechanics for entities.<br>
 * Where: This class is used by other classes to manage entity states.<br>
 * Additional Info: The class uses maps to store and retrieve the state information for entities.
 * </p>
 * Key Methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #getFlyingState(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the flying state of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setFlyingState(LivingEntity, boolean)} - Sets the flying state of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getCanFly(LivingEntity)} - Checks if the entity is capable of flight.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setCanFly(LivingEntity, boolean)} - Sets whether the entity can fly.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getFlyingCooldown(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the cooldown period between flights for the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setFlyingCooldown(LivingEntity, int)} - Sets the cooldown period between flights for the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getSwimmingState(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the swimming state of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setSwimmingState(LivingEntity, boolean)} - Updates the swimming state of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getSwimmingCooldown(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the swimming cooldown period of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setSwimmingCooldown(LivingEntity, int)} - Updates the swimming cooldown period of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getTamingItem(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the taming item associated with the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setTamingItem(LivingEntity, String)} - Updates the taming item for the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getFollowingState(LivingEntity)} - Retrieves the following state of the entity.</li>
 * <li>{@link #setFollowingState(LivingEntity, boolean)} - Updates the following state of the entity.</li>
